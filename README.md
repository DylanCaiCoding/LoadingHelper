# LoadingHelper

English | [中文](README_CN.md)

>**This library was renamed [LoadingStateView](https://github.com/DylanCaiCoding/LoadingStateView).**

It is a highly expandable Android library for showing loading status view on the low-coupling way, it is implemented with a Kotlin code of less than 300 lines without comment statement . it not only **shows different view like loading, content, error, empty or customized view** when loading network data, but also **manages title bar.**

## Why rename

This library contains two functions for displaying loading status view and managing title bar, so it used a neutral name `LoadingHelper`. However, the name is not easily associated with the function of displaying loading status view,  and it is also easy to misunderstand whether it is also possible to manage loading dialog. Managing the title bar is important, but it's actually an accessibility feature for adding decorative views. So decided to change the name.

## Migration Guide
